# Question #9

Great.  Now I'd like to create an integration test to verify that it actually works over HTTP.  Let's try creating a test to get real `timetrack` records.  Let's use `stopAfter=3` so that we'll likely exercise our pagination.  I also want to be able to run my integration tests separate from my unit tests (including the 4 we've written together).  Please explain how I can run these separately while continuing to use the `unittest` library and not introduce `pytest`.

# Answer #9

Sure! To create an integration test to verify that your API client works over HTTP, you can write a test method that makes a real HTTP request to the API and checks that the response is valid.

Here's an example `integration_test_api.py`:

```python
import unittest
import os
from app.api import ApiClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv


class TestIntegrationApiClient(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        load_dotenv() # Load environment variables
        self.client = ApiClient()

    def test_fetch_large_data(self):
        # Call the fetch_data method to get a large amount of data
        data = self.client.fetch_data(stopAfter=3,dateFrom="2023-03-10")

        # Test that the response is valid
        self.assertIsInstance(data, list)
        self.assertGreater(len(data), 0)
        # ... more assertions as needed
```

To run only the integration test, you can use the `-k` option with the pattern that matches the name of your integration test:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "integration_test_*"
```

To run only the unit tests, you can use the `-k` option with the pattern that matches the name of your unit test:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*"
```

Alternatively, you can run both sets of tests by running the discover command without the `-p` option:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

        # Test that the response is valid
        self.assertIsInstance(data, list)
        self.assertGreater(len(data), 0)
        # ... more assertions as needed

python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "integration_test_*"

```
