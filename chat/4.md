How can I see a testing code coverage report?

# Answer #4

To see a testing code coverage report, you can use a code coverage tool such as Coverage.py. Here's how you can use Coverage.py to generate a coverage report for your test suite:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

Run your test suite using Coverage.py:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will run your test suite and track the coverage of your code.

Generate a coverage report using Coverage.py:

```bash
coverage report
```

This will generate a coverage report showing the percentage of code coverage for each module in your project.

You can also generate an HTML report that provides a more detailed view of the coverage information:

```bash
coverage html
```

This will generate an HTML report in the htmlcov directory that you can view in your web browser.

By running your test suite with Coverage.py, you can see which parts of your code are covered by your tests and identify any areas that need additional testing.
