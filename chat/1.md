# Question #1

I'm building a small test-driven python app that will talk to some REST endpoints to pull in some data and do some transformation of the data.  What is the best way to setup my folder structure and get started with a failing unit test?

# Answer #1

Great question! Setting up a good folder structure is important to keep your code organized and maintainable as your project grows.

Here's a possible folder structure that you could use for your project:

```bash
project/
|-- app/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- main.py
|   |-- api.py
|   |-- transform.py
|-- tests/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- test_api.py
|   |-- test_transform.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- README.md
```

The app/ directory contains all the code for your application. The __init__.py file is required to mark the app/ directory as a package. The main.py file could be used to run your application, while the api.py file could contain code for interacting with the REST API, and the transform.py file could contain code for transforming the data.

The tests/ directory contains all your unit tests. The __init__.py file is required to mark the tests/ directory as a package. The test_api.py file could contain tests for the api.py module, and the test_transform.py file could contain tests for the transform.py module.

The requirements.txt file contains a list of Python packages that your project depends on. You can use this file to install all the required packages with a single command. The README.md file is a markdown file that describes your project.

To get started with a failing unit test, you could create a new file test_api.py in the tests/ directory and write a simple test that fails. Here's an example:

```python
import unittest
from app.api import ApiClient

class TestApiClient(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_data(self):
        # Test that fetch_data does not return none.
        client = ApiClient()
        data = client.fetch_data()
        self.assertIsNotNone(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we import the ApiClient class from the app.api module and write a test that checks that the fetch_data method returns something other than None. Running this test should fail because the fetch_data method hasn't been implemented yet. You can use this failing test as a starting point for implementing the fetch_data method and verifying that it works correctly.

# Action #1

```bash
cd project

mkdir app
touch app/__init__.py
touch app/api.py
touch app/transform.py

mkdir tests
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/test_api.py
touch tests/test_transform.py


cat <<EOT > tests/test_api.py
import unittest
from app.api import ApiClient

class TestApiClient(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_data(self):
        # Test that fetch_data does not return none.
        client = ApiClient()
        data = client.fetch_data()
        self.assertIsNotNone(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
EOT

```
