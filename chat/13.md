# Question #13

Write some cloudformation to create a private S3 bucket in AWS.  Please follow security best practices for setting up a non-public bucket that will house confidential / secure information.  Export the name of the name of the bucket.

# Answer #13

Here's an example CloudFormation template to create a private S3 bucket:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-private-bucket
      AccessControl: Private
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      LoggingConfiguration:
        DestinationBucketName: my-logging-bucket
        LogFilePrefix: my-private-bucket-logs/
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: AES256
```

This template creates a private S3 bucket with the name my-private-bucket. The AccessControl property is set to Private, which means that only the bucket owner and authorized users or services can access the bucket. The PublicAccessBlockConfiguration property is used to block public access to the bucket and its contents. The VersioningConfiguration property is used to enable versioning on the bucket, which allows you to store multiple versions of an object. The LoggingConfiguration property is used to specify a logging bucket and log file prefix for the S3 access logs. Finally, the BucketEncryption property is used to enable server-side encryption on the bucket with the AES256 encryption algorithm.

To export the name of the bucket, you can add an `Outputs` section to the template:

```yaml
Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Value: !Ref MyBucket
    Export:
      Name: MyBucketName
```

This exports the name of the bucket as a CloudFormation export with the name MyBucketName. You can then use this export value in other CloudFormation templates or AWS services.
