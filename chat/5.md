# Question #5

```bash
% coverage report

---------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        20      1    95%

I expected to only see coverage results for my production code (in the `app/` folder), not the test code (in the `tests/` folder).

# Answer #5

The coverage report you shared appears to include coverage results for both your production code (in the `app/` folder) and your test code (in the `tests/` folder).

To exclude the test code from the coverage report, you can use the `--omit` option when running Coverage.py. The `--omit` option allows you to specify which files or directories should be omitted from the coverage report.

For example, if you want to exclude the `tests/` directory from the coverage report, you can run Coverage.py with the following command:

```bash
coverage run --omit "tests/*" -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will run your test suite and exclude any files in the `tests/` directory from the coverage report.

Alternatively, you can also use a configuration file to specify which files or directories to include or exclude from the coverage report. You can create a file named `.coveragerc` in the root directory of your project and specify the files or directories to include or exclude in this file. Here's an example `.coveragerc` file that excludes the `tests/` directory from the coverage report:

```
[run]
omit =
    tests/*
```

With this configuration file in place, you can simply run Coverage.py with the coverage run command without any additional arguments:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This will run your test suite and exclude the tests/ directory from the coverage report based on the settings in your `.coveragerc` file.

# Action #5

```bash
cat <<EOT > .coveragerc
[run]
omit =
    tests/*
EOT
```


Run these again:

```
coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests && \
coverage report && \
coverage html && \
open htmlcov/index.html
```
