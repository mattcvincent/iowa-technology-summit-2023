# Question #3

From the command-line, how do I run the unit test?  Which directory do I run the command from?

# Answer #3

To run your unit tests from the command line, you can use the unittest module that comes with Python. Here's an example command to run all the tests in your project:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This command tells Python to use the unittest module to discover and run all the tests in the `tests/` directory. You should run this command from the top-level directory of your project (i.e., the directory that contains the `app/` and `tests/` directories).

Alternatively, if you want to run a specific test file or test case, you can use the `-k` option to specify a pattern to match the names of the tests you want to run. For example, to run only the tests in the `test_api.py` file, you could use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_api.py
```

This command tells Python to run all the tests in files matching `test_api.py` in the tests/ directory. You can also use the `-k` option to match test case names. For example, to run only the `TestApiClient` test case from the `test_api.py` file, you could use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_api.py -k TestApiClient
```

This command tells Python to run only the tests in the `TestApiClient` test case from files matching `test_api.py` in the tests/ directory.

![Red Green Refactor](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:950/format:webp/1*IbHgZrKYCUSeIbL_PywObQ.png)

Run the failing test:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Pass the test:

```bash
cat <<EOT > app/api.py
import os

class ApiClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.url = os.environ['ACTITIME_URL']
        self.username = os.environ['ACTITIME_USERNAME']
        self.password = os.environ['ACTITIME_PASSWORD']

    def fetch_data(self):
        # TODO: Implement fetching data from the API
        return []
EOT

```
