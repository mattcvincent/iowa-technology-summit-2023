# Question #10a

Here's some context before I ask you a question. Here's what the directory structure looks like:

# Answer #10a

Thanks for providing the directory structure. What is your question?

# Question #10b

My code is hosted in GitHub.  I'd like to create a GitHub workflow with multiple steps:
1. Checkout the code
2. `cd` into the `project` directory
3. Install requirements.txt
4. Set the environment variables (ACTITIME_URL, ACTITIME_USERNAME, ACTITIME_PASSWORD) with GitHub secrets by the same name.
4. Run all of the unit and integration tests (`coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests`)
5. Print out the coverage report (`coverage report`)
6. Produce an HTML coverage report (`coverage html`)
7. Upload the coverage report (in `project/htmlcov`) as a GitHub artifact

Can you write a workflow file for me that accomplishes these steps?

# Answer #10b

Sure, here's a sample workflow file that should accomplish the steps you described:

```yaml
name: Test and Coverage

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Set environment variables
      env:
        ACTITIME_URL: ${{ secrets.ACTITIME_URL }}
        ACTITIME_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.ACTITIME_USERNAME }}
        ACTITIME_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ACTITIME_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        echo $ACTITIME_URL
        echo $ACTITIME_USERNAME
        echo $ACTITIME_PASSWORD

    - name: Run unit tests with coverage
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage run --source . -m unittest discover -s tests

    - name: Print coverage report
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage report

    - name: Generate HTML coverage report
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage html

    - name: Upload coverage report as artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: project/htmlcov

```

In this workflow file, the on section specifies that the workflow should run on push and pull request events on the main branch. The test job has several steps:

* Checkout the code using the `actions/checkout` action.
* Install the dependencies using `pip`.
* Set the environment variables using the secrets object and env key.
* Run the tests with coverage using coverage run.
* Print the coverage report using coverage report.
* Generate the HTML coverage report using coverage html.
* Upload the HTML coverage report as an artifact using the `actions/upload-artifact` action.

You can copy this file into your `.github/workflows` directory and customize it as needed for your project.

# Action #10

Note and fix the security flaw.

Add the GitHub Actions Workflow:

```bash
cd ../
mkdir -p .github/workflows/

cat <<EOT > .github/workflows/python-app.yml
name: Test and Coverage

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Set environment variables
      env:
        ACTITIME_URL: \${{ secrets.ACTITIME_URL }}
        ACTITIME_USERNAME: \${{ secrets.ACTITIME_USERNAME }}
        ACTITIME_PASSWORD: \${{ secrets.ACTITIME_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        echo "ACTITIME_URL=\${ACTITIME_URL}" >> \$GITHUB_ENV
        echo "ACTITIME_USERNAME=\${ACTITIME_USERNAME}" >> \$GITHUB_ENV
        echo "ACTITIME_PASSWORD=\${ACTITIME_PASSWORD}" >> \$GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Run unit tests with coverage
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage run --source . -m unittest discover -s tests

    - name: Print coverage report
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage report

    - name: Generate HTML coverage report
      working-directory: ./project
      run: |
        coverage html

    - name: Upload coverage report as artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: project/htmlcov
EOT

cd project/
```

Push to GitHub, then visit [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mattcvincent/ai-assisted/actions/)
