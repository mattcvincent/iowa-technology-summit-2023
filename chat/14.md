# Question #14

I put the CloudFormation in `./iac/bucket.yaml`

Please create another GitHub actions workflow that applies this cloudformation template (use this action: `aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy`).  Please tag the stack with 'owner=Matt Vincent'.  Only run the workflow when the ./iac/bucket.yaml file changes.

I already have an OIDC trust setup between my GitHub Account and my AWS account.  Therefore, I don't want to pass in AWS ACCESS KEYs.  Instead, you can assume a role (with the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action) whose name is in a GitHub secrets as `AWS_ROLE` in the us-east-2 region.

# Answer #14

Sure, here's the updated `.github/workflows/bucket.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy Bucket

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'iac/**'
      - '.github/workflows/bucket.yml'
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  id-token: write # This is required for aws oidc connection
  contents: write # This is required for actions/checkout
  pull-requests: write # This is required for gh bot to comment PR

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure AWS credentials from AWS account
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1-node16
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE }}
          aws-region: us-east-2
          role-session-name: GitHub-OIDC
          role-duration-seconds: 1200

      - name: Deploy CloudFormation stack
        uses: aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy@v1
        with:
          name: iowa-technology-summit-2023-private-bucket
          template: iac/bucket.yml
          tags: '[{"Key": "owner", "Value": "Matt Vincent"}]'
          capabilities: CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

The workflow uses the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action to assume a role specified by the `AWS_ROLE` secret.

# Action #14


Create the new GitHub Actions Workflow:

```bash
cd ../

cat <<EOT > .github/workflows/bucket.yml
name: Deploy Bucket

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'iac/**'
      - '.github/workflows/bucket.yml'
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  id-token: write # This is required for aws oidc connection
  contents: write # This is required for actions/checkout
  pull-requests: write # This is required for gh bot to comment PR

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure AWS credentials from AWS account
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1-node16
        with:
          role-to-assume: \${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE }}
          aws-region: us-east-2
          role-session-name: GitHub-OIDC
          role-duration-seconds: 1200

      - name: Deploy CloudFormation stack
        uses: aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy@v1
        with:
          name: iowa-technology-summit-2023-private-bucket
          template: iac/bucket.yml
          tags: '[{"Key": "owner", "Value": "Matt Vincent"}]'
          capabilities: CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
EOT

cd project/

```


Push to GitHub, then visit:

1. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mattcvincent/ai-assisted/actions/)
